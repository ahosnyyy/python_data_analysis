# Chapter 1: Introduction to Data Analysis

This section will teach you the fundamentals of data analysis, give you a foundation in statistics, and get your environment set up for working with data in Python and using Jupyter Notebooks.

## Content

The first notebook provides an overview of essential data analysis and statistics concepts needed to progress through the course. You can follow along with the examples in the [`introduction_to_data_analysis.ipynb`](./introduction_to_data_analysis.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook.

Practice exercises for this section can be found in the  [`exercises.ipynb`](./exercises.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook.

*Tip: Use the [`python_101.ipynb`](./python_101.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook for a Python crash-course/refresher, if needed.*
